Make sure you have node installed.

To watch and build our server and client scripts, run:

```sh
yarn watch:scripts
```

Always have that task running when developing.

To launch the server for client-side examples:

```sh
yarn live-server
```

To launch a server-side example in node:

```sh
yarn nodemon build/example_xx
```

Where "xx" is example number.
